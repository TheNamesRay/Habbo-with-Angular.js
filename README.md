ngHabbo (PHP + JS)
=====================

A single-themed Habbo Content Management System using Angular.js and a PHP API. Angular is getting more popular than ever and single page applications are becoming a thing now.

**Works exclusively with Azure Emulator Database**

### Features ###

* Single Page Application
* Model View Controller
* Authentication & Logout
* Session Handling
* Flexible REST Routes
* Very Modular
* Localization

> Is this finished, though?

This is not finished. And will never be. This should give you a head start on how to create Habbo SPAs using Angular, and how sessions, user data, and other stuff should be handled with a PHP API.
