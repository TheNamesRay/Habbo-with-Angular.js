ngHabbo (PHP + AngularJS)
=====================

A single-themed Habbo Content Management System using AngularJS and a PHP API. Angular is getting more popular than ever and single page applications are becoming a thing now.

**Works exclusively with Azure Emulator Database**

### Features ###

* Single Page Application
* Model View Controller
* Authentication & Logout
* Session Handling
* Flexible REST Routes
* Very Modular
* Localization

### Missing ###

* All pages except Index, Registration, 404, Me & Logout
* Control Panel

Although these are easy to do, just really time consuming. For only these pages I've already created more than 10 javascript files. Just remember to rely heavily on the server with Ajax requests with everything risky (account management, control panel, store...)

> Will you finish this, though?

This is not finished. And will never be. This should give you a head start on how to create Habbo SPAs using Angular, and how sessions, user data, and other stuff should be handled with a PHP API.

> Need help?

If you really want to learn Angular and how to make a HabboCMS based on it, just hit me up on Skype: ThePoliticallyCorrect. I'll be glad to help you with anything you'd want to do.

> Why AngularJS?

Model View Controller done right, two-way data binding, HTML extensions (directives) to make your life easier, less code and more functionality, context aware communication (events, broadcasting...) ... and much more.
